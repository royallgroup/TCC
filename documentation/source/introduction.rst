Introduction to the Topological Cluster Classification
**********************************************************

This documentation gives information about the latest version of the Topological Cluster Classification (TCC). It also covers the associated python scripts and tools provided with the TCC.

The TCC is an algorithm for identifying structure in condesed matter systems. The idea was first concieved by Stephen Williams (The Australian National University). It was developed to a working algorithm by Alex Malins as part of his PhD at the Univeristy of Bristol from 2009 to 2012. It was largely rewritten by Peter Crowther during his PhD at Bristol in 2017-18. It was publically released on GitHub in June 2018. The TCC has been used in over 30 publication which are detailed in the :doc:`publications` section.
